# Flappy-Bird-AI
A neuroevolution algorithm based  AI for Flappy Bird
# How to Use
Execute the program from Frame class, which contains a main method
# NEAT Algorithm
AI is contained in the NeuralNetwork and Simulator class. You can experiment with the number of players
# Mutation Rate
Mutation rate is a constant which determines how much will be changed in the offspring. You will find this variable in NeuralNetwork class
# Fitness function
double fitness in Bird class stores and updates the fitness
# Game
Experiment with the pipe width and gap from the Game class, and speed from Wall class
# Play
Play the game yourself by changing boolean playable in Simulator class to true
